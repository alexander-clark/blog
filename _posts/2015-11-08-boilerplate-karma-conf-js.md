I&#8217;ve worked on a number of Angular apps, but most of them were either set up by someone else or created using Yeoman or something similar.

Earlier today I was trying to get Karma and Jasmine working so I could write some tests for a small new application. I had spent some time googling boilerplate karma.conf.js files and trying to fill in the gaps. Finally, I stumbled across the <kbd>karma init</kbd> command, which walks you through generatingÂ a boilerplate karma.conf.js.

## The bigger lesson

Aside from the obvious lesson of &#8220;use karma init,&#8221; I think the other takeaway here is the importance of familiarizing oneself with the tools one uses every day.
